This was my first time interacting with a Micro:bit and I was appalled at the vast tools that I needed to be familiar with in order to proceed with the upcoming assessments. Like any piece of software, the first program should be "Hello World.", therefore, successfully completing this experiment meant that I was able to learn the basic mechanics of a Micro:bit.

Since this is a "Hello World." experiment, a real world application would be based on making sure that any programming language is running properly on their hosted server, i.e.: Swift on Xcode.

#### Reflection ####

After learning the simple mechanics of a Micro:bit, I made progressed by learning the different features of the Micro:bit. I choose this experiment, because I wanted to start off by understanding how different environments' settings will interact , i.e. the photoresistor. 
In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
