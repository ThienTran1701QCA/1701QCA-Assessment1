This was my first time interacting with a Micro:bit and I was appalled at the vast tools that I needed to be familiar with in order to proceed with the upcoming assessments. Like any piece of software, the first program should be "Hello World.", therefore, successfully completing this experiment meant that I was able to learn the basic mechanics of a Micro:bit.

Since this is a "Hello World." experiment, a real world application would be based on making sure that any programming language is running properly on their hosted server, i.e.: Swift on Xcode.

After learning the simple mechanics of a Micro:bit, I made progressed by learning the different features of the Micro:bit. I choose this experiment, because I wanted to start off by understanding how different environments' settings will interact with the Micro:bit's features, i.e. the photoresistor. After experimenting, I came to the conclusion that the photoresistor is a dependent on the amount of light source, and that the light source can be adjustable when coding. 

This experiment can be applied in a real world solar panel project. The photoresistor can act as a light dectetor, the Micro:bit as a energy calculator converts the sunlight into energy.

In this experiment, I learned how to sustain control a LED Light. The strategic importance of having control in any experiments lays in the difficulty level of experiments, where this can be best represented in later experiments that I will be conducting. 

This experiment can be crucial in the world's efforts of reducing the ussage of electricity. Including a Potentiometer in everyday's electronics and households item can provide a large difference in the consumption of electricity.

I learned how to make simple music/sound with the Micro:bit. I realised that being able to making a simple sound could assist me in future projects, because interacting with sounds is an essential elemet in all projects. 

Likewise to what has been stated, I believe that making sound is present in all real world applications. However, adjusting sounds must be considered when creating a real world application, i.e.: a microwave beeping sound is different than a car's horn.

In this experiment, I combined all of my learnings in the previous 4 experiments to make a pedestrian's crossing light. I was able to include variables like: controlling LED lights to flash on cue, made an awareness buzzer sound for the pedestrians to cross, 
In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
