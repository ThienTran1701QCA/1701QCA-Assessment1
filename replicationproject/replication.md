Similarly to my project, the Step Counter project allows the person to keep track of a variable - amount of steps for the Step Counter and amount of time for calculating velocity for my project.

The mechanics of the reaction game do share several elements, from the cardbox to the aluminum foil. By observing the Reaction Game project, I am able to understand how elements interact together.

The layout of this game is related to my project, in the sense that it is fundamentally a track. Both projects require an object - similar to a car and is being timed as they are completing the course. However, the most notable difference between the two projects is that game is calculating the amount of fixed laps, whereas my project calculates the velocity of the car after completing the course.

The image show my initial ideas for the project, there were four and I chose the fourth one. In my opinion, the fourth one is the closest replicated-yet-original idea for the project. In addition, the image also display the basic structural layout and elements that are crucial for the project, the interaction flow diagram, and the list of essential itineraries for the project.

The image demonstrates my original interaction flowchart and the initial's project layout. As represented, this is a very basic idea, demonstrating that this was during the earlier stages of designing and critiquing my project. 
## Project outcome ##

### Project title ###

Avoid the Obstacles Timed Track

### Project description ###

The goal of this project is to calculate the most optimal velocity of an all-terrian vehicle to cross a series of obstacles using the distance of the course over time it took to cross. A typical use case would be for an atv vehicle's manufacturer to test their vehicles on challenging terrains, similar to my obstacle course.

### Reflection ###

Assembling the overall track was straightforward, where it became the basic component of my project, thus making it the most successful aspect of the project. However, in terms of the more difficult sides, it would have to be the wiring. I used the crocodile clips as the main source to formulate the circut. Crocodile clips are difficult to connect and can be loosely if their anchor points does not match with what you are trying to clip, thus making the connection somewhat troublesome at first, but, I eventually attached the clips using a Swiss army knife. 
In regards to the possible room for improvements, I would need to find an alternative method to cover the wires and the external battery, as they are still considered loosely.
